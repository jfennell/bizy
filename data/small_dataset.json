He informed me that their ISP has been out to rewire the shop since my review was written.  I have not been back to confirm this, but it's possible that the wifi problems I experienced have been fixed.  In fairness to them, I wanted to update my review with this information.  If I go back and find that the problem has been resolved, I'll be sure and update here again.\n---------\nI'm currently at Flipnotics, having just left JP Java because I could not get their freaking wi-fi to work, despite trying no less than 1,000,000 times over an hour period with several different programs and asking the poor dude behind the counter to reset their modem twice.  I know it wasn't just me, because several other people in there were having the same problem, and the first time I said something to the counter dude, he said, \"Sometimes you have to just keep trying...the connection is a little spotty.\"\n\nThis is a deal-breaker for me.  I don't generally go to coffee houses unless I plan to work.  Plus, how am I supposed to procrastinate on Yelp if I don't have wi-fi?  Duh.\n\nPlus, I *specifically* asked the guy before buying my $4 drink whether they had free wi-fi, and he issued no warning whatsoever about their spotty connection.  Grrrr.\n\nSo, I camped out for an hour nursing a drink I'd already purchased, grumbling to myself because I couldn't do what I'd come there to do.\n\nIf wi-fi isn't important to you, however, this place is pretty cool.  I loved the decor - a great mix of big, comfy, leather chairs and a pretty good amount of table seating, too (with padded chairs - thank you).  If you're using a laptop and need juice, do check for outlets before you choose a spot to sit, as some of the tables don't have outlets nearby.  They also have a nice little patio.  The music is a hair on the loud side for my taste, but again, I was there to work - if you're just visiting or are good at tuning out music, then it might be fine for you.\n\nI did like my iced chai, and liked that they offer thai tea, as well.  You can also \"frappe\" many of their drinks for an additional 60 cents, which means that they add a concoction of sugar and creamer that makes it all frothy and stuff.\n\nService was friendly and I noticed they carry breakfast tacos from Elsi's and paninis in addition to the usual selection of baked goods - something I always appreciate when I'm camping out somewhere for a while working.\n\nBut, like I said, lack of wi-fi is a dealbreaker for me.  Especially when I specifically ask first if they have it.\n\nFortunately, Flipnotics was right here for me, ready to catch me on the rebound.  I love you, Flipnotics.  I won't ever leave you again.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DARh6yjrGGVZ7R3Gdh4CMA"}

In the end, I opted for the chicken fettuccine while le petit ami ordered the Cajun macaroni and cheese. I was happy to find out that some of their dishes come in two sizes for those who wanted a lighter dinner, such as myself. The price difference was $4 dollars between the two sizes, which wasn't so bad. Our food came in about 15 minutes and was piping hot. My chicken fettuccine included spinach fettuccine in a creamy parmesan sauce with grilled chicken, tomatoes, mushrooms, and walnuts on tops. It was so savory and perfect in every way! The sauce wasn't too cheesy and complemented the grilled chicken just right. i usually don't like tomatoes, but since they were diced in this dish, I didn't mind them too much. As for the spinach fettuccine, it was cooked al dente- just the way I like it. My stomach was extremely content after i finished every last bit of my pasta. Mon petit ami also loved the Cajun macaroni and cheese, which had chicken, sausages, bacon, and scallions under a spicy tomato cream sauce and parmesan panko crumb topping. I had a bite of it. It wasn't too spicy and definitely changed my definition of macaroni and cheese. The crumb topping had a distinct texture, which was nice in the midst of all the pasta and different meats.

Service is always great at the bar and was acceptable though less notable in the restaurant.  I'm usually here during the week and some nights the bar area gets pretty packed, so I'm sure it's often busy during the weekend.  I would rate just about all of the meals I've had here as above average pub food.  I did get an average to slightly below average burger on one visit, but I've had the same meal (burger with brie) 2-3 other times and its been great.  I'm also a huge fan of the buffalo chicken tenders.  They actually pack some heat which is something so many \"hot\" wings/tenders seem to missing at a lot of the places I go.  I can also vouch for their dinner salads being more than enough to serve as a great meal.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HIPGr2gSEN4T73tjz47hpw"}

I just drink the coffee to stay awake and no other purpose. I enjoy the atmosphere with random artwork on the walls and eclectic student population and others alike. Hipsterish crowd at times but what coffee shop isn't hipster-like unless you are called Starbucks. \n\nThe food is good...well specifically the roast beef and brie sandwich. Snack selection is fair with lots of pastries, but everything is generally pricey. They also have beer on tap...yes, beer at a coffee shop and I actually saw some people drinking while studying. I mean I like a good beer but while studying I'll fall asleep (definitely not what I want with a test the next day) Beer was a definite change from 10 yrs ago and I would have considered coming here for non studying purposes.\n\nFree wireless internet but its very erratic with constant disconnects every hour or two. It's good enough and pretty fast.\n\nParking is in a small lot with side street parking. Daytime is pretty easy to find parking.\n\nOutdoor patio is nice with large umbrellas to shade you from being burnt to crisp. In the summer it might be miserable and they might have fans? but I do remember them having portable heaters in the winters 10 yrs ago.

For one, I generally think of coffee shops as fairly progressive in nature, seeing as they primarily house academics, anarchists and starving artists. For two, aside from the generalizations, it seems strange to think of a place that serves coffee, tea and baked goods as a devoted member of any established political party. There are other reasons for my amusement, but I won't belabour the point.\n\nAside from the bad taste in my mouth from having said the R word (kidding, kidding), there are a couple things I really like about JP's Java. As Alexandra has already pointed out, the place has a good-sized deck out front that is ideal for people watching. Seriously...very cool spot for staring off into space whilst pretending to study. My friend Oliver (R.I.P.) used to do this once a week or so, and he looked entirely comfortable sitting there on the JP's deck (despite his ties to the women's movement). Secondly, I like their interior layout and their convenient location.\n\nThe drawbacks to JP's are 1) the occasional haunting quiet and 2) their lack of good desserts. There's also a strange vibe to the place that I can't pick up on...makes me a little uncomfortable....but I think that's me, not JP. Their coffee is okay, but not great.\n\nAnyway, might be worth a visit if you're near UT's campus.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DARh6yjrGGVZ7R3Gdh4CMA"}

So it was $60 for a 60 minute massage. Something oh so hard to come by in Boston. \n\nThis is not the place to go if you want a frilly, Swedish massage with lots of oils!

Seriously I think they took jarred chopped garlic and mixed it with ketchup. \n\nMy friend had the Belgian waffle topped with ice cream and whipped cream. He seemed to like it.

This place has had a very large hand in my graduation from UT Austin.  \n\nThis adorable, hole-in-the-wall, yet trendy (but in a not-so-hipster way) coffee joint has the best study atmosphere anywhere near campus.  It's barista's choice for music selection here, but luckily JP seems to make good music taste an employee requirement.  You usually get hit with a wave of mellow hip hop-esque beats when you walk into the comfy grey and brown interior and walk up to the only clover coffee machines in Texas.  \n\nJP's installed a small bar with tap beer (and wine coolers..) about a year and a half ago, and also put in a couple flat screens (medium sized, not sports bar size).  This has resulted in a bbq every UT football game day and a rather diverse clientele (or more diverse than it was before).  However, sans game times and happy hours, JP's is the same it always has been: mellow, warm, and usually crawling with grad students, TA's, professors (a surprising amount of my old UT prof's frequented this place a TON), and the occasional frat kids.  Everyone is friendly that works here, and the clients are all a chill bunch.  \n\nSo after all this raving, why not the full 5 star review?  Although JP's has great quality coffee, it's all extremely overpriced.  You end up paying for the drink AND the atmosphere, which I am totally willing to do, but the reasonably priced places are the ones I reserve 5 stars for.  \n\nJP's is still my favorite study spot on campus (it's only a block away, I still call it campus), and I will really miss it in the spring when I move from Austin.  Highly recommend this place for students who need a strong coffee and a study space - and if it's finals time, be prepared to wait for a table or else get here early in the day!", "type": "review", "business_id": "DARh6yjrGGVZ7R3Gdh4CMA"}

The Clover machine is super pricey, and only makes itself available to coffee shops that sell the finest coffee around.  They choose their clients.\n\nJP's is the only place in Texas that has a Clover.  In the whole wide state!  That alone made us want to check out JP's.  One night when we both had a lot of stuff to do, we went to see about a Clover.  The Clover brewed coffee was hands down the best cup of drip my husband had ever tasted.  He is like a Clover fiend now.\n\nTheir freshly squeezed lemonade was excellent for my non-coffee likin' self.  The place was packed at 8pm on a Sunday night, so we ended up with the table way way way back on the patio, where the electrical socket didn't work and the table was cheap and a little dirty.  Wireless still came through like a champ though, and if you're a UT student, you can also connect to their network, too.  Both were in range.\n\nI mean, if they're busy, they're busy, but maybe they could upgrade those few tables in the back, or make sure to wipe them off with the rest.

And on a nice day they open the garage door windows and the inside is just as pleasant as enjoying the outside and I don't have to worry about my notes flying away or the glare from the sun.\n\n\nThis is the best coffee shop near campus because it's not Starbuck's, the music is not obnoxious, they have a patio, and the coffee is yummy. Maybe I am not an expert but I like JP's and its people.", "type": "review", "business_id": "DARh6yjrGGVZ7R3Gdh4CMA"}

Never have I encountered a town more impressed with itself. I had the misfortune to live there for 6 years and let me tell you, I'm still recovering.\nSo, read the following review bearing this in mind.\n\nWinberie's is a fine place to go if you want some tasty, pub-style food and don't mind slow service.  Most of the offerings are overpriced;; I don't think there's a burger on the menu that isn't $10 or more, and for no discernible reason. Sodas are almost $3! Sheesh. Bartenders are generally excellent, but be prepared for a VERY crowded bar during peak times and games. It can be extremely loud, too. Sit in the restaurant area if you want to hear yourself think.\nDecor is simple and homey- think Applebee's-style framed local items and art pieces showcasing local famous folks (Einstein, Peter Benchley, yadda yadda).\n\nParking in Princeton is always a problem, so if you don't live within walking distance expect to pay to use one of the nearby garages. Thankfully, the rates are reasonable.", "type": "review", "business_id": "HIPGr2gSEN4T73tjz47hpw"}

I'm giving a high rating to a property management company. Hell hath frozen over.\n\nBut seriously, these guys are good. From my very quick move in schedule (I first viewed the apartment just a few days before I moved in, and they managed to clean and touch up the paint that quickly) to the ease of moveout, I really appreciated the hard work of Jenn and Charley and the rest of the folks here. \n\nWhen I moved in the shower was very slow to drain and within a few hours the OWNER of Cooper Brown was out to personally de-clog my shower from the last tenant. Impressive. I luckily didn't have any other maintenance issues with my apartment, but I loved that Cooper Brown was easily accessible via email and phone calls, and they always got back to me quickly when I did have questions (or when they had questions for me). Their office is conveniently located in the Biltmore so I often ended up saving my 40-whatever cents and dropping off my rent rather than mailing it, which was nice. \n\nAt moveout, things were equally straightforward and easy. I was able to schedule a moveout inspection on my own time, and Charley was great about going through and explaining what would be taken out of my security deposit (which honestly wasn't much). The way they do their utilities is a little weird: you pay a flat fee each month and then at the end of your lease you either owe more or get money back. They don't provide you with any update of where you stand throughout the year, which would have been nice, but not a big deal. Since I'm a bit of a treehugger and don't really use my thermostat or overhead lighting, I got a nice little chunk of change back with my security deposit.

I found a property of theirs online in the Healy Building downtown.  The pictures of the property looked flawless online, but when I went to actually view the property it was filthy and the wooden cabinets were so worn out.  The tile in the shower was scary, and clearly needed to be replaced.  They wanted my deposit which was 45$ higher than the actual rent before my application was even processed, and had no sort of receipt to give me. The condo was listed as having stainless steel appliances, but of course the fridge was steel with black plastic handles and a black microwave.  I won't even get started on the dishwasher.  I was also informed that I would get a confirmation call an hour before the viewing but the agent called me just twenty minutes beforehand.  When I met her there her hair was sopping wet.  I felt this was extremely unprofessional.  I spoke to the receptionist a few days before the viewing and she told me I would not need to have the deposit until after my application had been processed, but of course the agent wanted a check as soon as I saw the place.  These people are confused and have no idea how to make renter/buyer feel confident in their purchase.  My biggest reason for no longer doing business with them is the fact that I told them I needed an immediate move-in and they lolly-gagged with the process because they could not contact my landlord from four years ago, who probably doesn't even remember me! I just told them to forget it and I would be there to pick up my check.  There should not be such a lengthy process for a condo with no parking, black appliances, and a building where young men like to stand out front and socialize.
